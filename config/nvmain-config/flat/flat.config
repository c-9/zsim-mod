; This configuration file gives an example hybrid memory system.
; A hybrid memory system consists of 2 or more channels of memory,
; where at least one channel is of different technology or uses a
; different interconnect. Examples of this include DRAM/NVM hybrids
; or same technology with one channel being used as 3D-stacked 
; memory. In this file, we consider a DRAM/PCM system which uses
;*#### main memory size: 32GB         ####*
